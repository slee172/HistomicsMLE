 Training classifiers with HistomicsML2	
=======================================

This page describes how to use the HistomicsML2 interface to train classification rules using the example data provided in the Docker container.

A video tutorial of this content is available here:

Initializing the classifier	
-------------------------	

Go to http://localhost/HistomicsML/.	

Under *Start a session* enter a training set name and select the pre-loaded The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) dataset from the drop-down menu. Enter names for your classes - in our case we will follow the example of our paper use ``TILs`` for the positive class and ``non-TILs`` for the negative class.

After clicking ``Begin`` the ``Prime`` interface will be loaded to collect annotations in order to initialize the classifier. The drop-down can be used to select a slides to display in the slide viewer. Zoom to a region of interest in the slide, then click ``Show Segmentation`` to display object boundaries. After clicking ``Select Superpixels``, you will be prompted to select four objects from each class. Double-clicking an object in the slide viewer will add this object to the training set, and display a thumbnail image of the object above the slide viewer.	

.. image:: images/prime.png	

We selected 4 examples of positive superpixels and 4 examples of negative superpixels in this example.	

.. note:: You can remove objects from the training set in this menu by double clicking their thumbnail images.	

With the initial annotation complete, click ``Prime`` to create the classifier. There will be a small delay while the classifier is trained and applied to the entire dataset to generate predictions for active learning.	

Heatmap-based active learning	
-------------------------	

The ``Gallery`` menu provides a high-level overview of the current classification results for the entire dataset. Each row displays heatmaps for a single slide - the left heatmap indicates the classifier uncertainty (red = more uncertain) - and the right heatmap indicates the positive class object density (red = higher density of positively classified objects). Slides are sorted in this view based on average uncertainty, with the slide having the most uncertaintly placed at the top.

Clicking a slide in the gallery will load this slide in the heatmap viewer, where the user can identify regions for annotation. Clicking ``Show Segmentation`` will display the heatmap overlay on the slide viewer, and the user can zoom to hotspots to provide corrections to the classifier.

At high-magnification, objects are displayed with color-coded superpixels to indicate their predicted class (green = positive). Prediction errors can be corrected directly in the slide viewer by painting superpixels after clicking ``Paint on``, adding this object to the training set. The classifier can be retrained with the ``Retrain`` button.	

.. image:: images/label.png	

.. note:: Object labels can be cycled in the heatmap menu by a drag-drop function after selecting ``Paint On``. An object can be removed from the training set by clicking ``Del``	

When the training is completed, click the ``Save`` or ``Finalize`` button to save the training set to the database. This training set can be reloaded and resumed from using the *Continue a session* option on the main page.	

Reviewing a training set	
------------------------------	
Annotations in a validation set can be reviewed using the review interface.	

At the home page under *Continue a session*, select the dataset and training set name and click ``Continue``. Navigate to the ``Review`` interface by clicking the tab at the top menu.	

.. image:: images/continue-session.png	

The review interface displays the annotated objects organized by class and slide. Thumbnail images of the objects are organized into columns by class. Clicking a thumbnail will bring that object into the field of view in the slide view. The thumbnails can be dragged/dropped to a different column to change the class label. Changes are instantly commited to the database (no additional button clicks are needed).
