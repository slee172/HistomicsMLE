HistomicsML-TA
===========

HistomicsML-TA is a tissue-agnostic framework for classifying histologic structures, that enables rapid development of accurate tissue classifiers in a tissue-agnostic framework using neural networks. HistomicsML-TA provides: (1) A web-based software that can be easily accessed through the web-browser displaying WSIs with objects annotated by a superpixel algorithm. (2) An interactive learning approach that enables experts in training tasks, delivering high accuracy over large volumes of histopathology images. (3) Applications: creating and loading classifiers, displaying heatmap, reviewing data, generating masks and importing data.
